  abstract = {The time dependent vehicle routing problem (TDVRP) is defined as follows. A vehicle fleet of fixed capacities serves customers of fixed demands from a central depot. Customers are assigned to vehicles and the vehicles routed so that the total time of the routes is minimized. The travel time between two customers or between a customer and the depot depends on the distance between the points and time of day. Time windows for serving the customers may also be present. The time dependent traveling salesman problem (TDTSP) is a special case of the TDVRP in which only one vehicle of infinite capacity is available. Mixed integer linear programming formulations of the TDVRP and the TDTSP are presented that treat the travel time functions as step functions. The characteristics and properties of the TDVRP preclude modification of most of the algorithms that have been developed for the vehicle routing problem. Several simple heuristic algorithms are given for the TDTSP and TDVRP without time windows based on the nearest-neighbor heuristic. A mathematical-programming-based heuristic for the TDTSP without time windows using cutting planes is also briefly discussed. Test results on small, randomly generated problems are reported.},

However, exact DP algorithms for the TSP have exponential storage and computational time requirements and can solve only very small problems. We present a restricted DP heuristic (a generalization of the nearest-neighbor heuristic) that can include all the above considerations but solves much larger problems. The heuristic cannot guarantee optimality because only a user- specified number of partial tours is retained at each stage. In this paper, the heuristic is implemented for the time dependent traveling salesman problem and is tested on a personal computer on randomly generated problems. The quality of the solutions improves, on average, as more computational time is permitted.},

We\npresent efficient adaptations of the A* algorithm for computing fastest\n(minimum travel time) paths from one origin node to one destination\nnode, for one as well as multiple departure times at the origin node, in\na class of dynamic networks the link travel times of which satisfy the\nfirst-in-first-out property. We summarize useful properties of dynamic\nnetworks and develop improved lower bounds on minimum travel times.\nThese lower bounds are exploited in designing efficient adaptations of\nthe A* algorithm to solve instances of the one-to-one dynamic fastest\npath problem. The developed algorithms are implemented and their\ncomputational performance is analyzed experimentally. The performance of\nthe computer implementations of the adaptations of the A* algorithm are\ncompared to a dynamic adaptation of Dijkstra's algorithm, stopped when\nthe destination node is selected. Comparative computational results\nobtained demonstrate that the algorithms of this paper are efficient.\nUsing a network containing 3000 nodes, 10 000 links, and 100 time\nintervals, the dynamic adaptations of the A* led to a savings ratio of\n11, in terms of number of nodes selected, and to a savings ratio of five\nin terms of computation time. The effect of the network size on the\nperformance of these adaptations is also studied. It is shown that the\ncomputational savings in term of both the number of nodes selected and\nthe computation time, increase with the size of the network topology\n},

However, while the RRT algorithm is known to be able to find a feasible solution quickly, there are no guarantees on the quality of such solution, e.g., with respect to a given cost functional. To address this limitation, the authors recently proposed a new algorithm, called RRT*, which ensures asymptotic optimality, i.e., almost sure convergence of the solution returned by the algorithm to an optimal solution, while maintaining the same properties of the standard RRT algorithm, both in terms of computation of feasible solutions, and of computational complexity. In this paper, the RRT* algorithm is extended to deal with differential constraints. A sufficient condition for asymptotic optimality is provided. It is shown that the RRT* algorithm equipped with any local steering procedure that satisfies this condition converges to an optimal solution almost surely. In particular, simple local steering procedures are provided for a Dubins' vehicle as well as a double integrator. Simulation examples are also provided for these systems comparing the RRT and the RRT* algorithms.},

  abstract      = {— Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are pop-ular in motion planning because they find solutions efficiently to single-query problems. Optimal RRTs (RRT*s) extend RRTs to the problem of finding the optimal solution, but in doing so asymptotically find the optimal path from the initial state to every state in the planning domain. This behaviour is not only inefficient but also inconsistent with their single-query nature. For problems seeking to minimize path length, the subset of states that can improve a solution can be described by a prolate hyperspheroid. We show that unless this subset is sam-pled directly, the probability of improving a solution becomes arbitrarily small in large worlds or high state dimensions. In this paper, we present an exact method to focus the search by directly sampling this subset. The advantages of the presented sampling technique are demonstrated with a new algorithm, Informed RRT*. This method retains the same probabilistic guarantees on complete-ness and optimality as RRT* while improving the convergence rate and final solution quality. We present the algorithm as a simple modification to RRT* that could be further extended by more advanced path-planning algorithms. We show exper-imentally that it outperforms RRT* in rate of convergence, final solution cost, and ability to find difficult passages while demonstrating less dependence on the state dimension and range of the planning problem.},

By recognizing that a set of samples describes an implicit random geometric graph (RGG), we are able to combine the efficient ordered nature of graph-based techniques, such as A*, with the anytime scalability of sampling-based algorithms, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). BIT* uses a heuristic to efficiently search a series of increasingly dense implicit RGGs while reusing previous information. It can be viewed as an extension of incremental graph-search techniques, such as Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*), to continuous problem domains as well as a generalization of existing sampling-based optimal planners. It is shown that it is probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal. We demonstrate the utility of BIT* on simulated random worlds in {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}2{\$} and {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}8{\$} and manipulation problems on CMU's HERB, a 14-DOF two-armed robot. On these problems, BIT* finds better solutions faster than RRT, RRT*, Informed RRT*, and Fast Marching Trees (FMT*) with faster anytime convergence towards th by unee optimum, especially in high dimensions.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we present a novel probabilistic sampling-based motion planning algorithm called the Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT*). The algorithm is specifically aimed at solving complex motion planning problems in high-dimensional configuration spaces. This algorithm is proven to be asymptotically optimal and is shown to converge to an optimal solution faster than its state-of-the-art counterparts, chiefly, PRM* and RRT*. An additional advantage of FMT* is that it builds and maintains paths in a tree-like structure (especially useful for planning under differential constraints). The FMT* algorithm essentially performs a "lazy" dynamic programming recursion on a set of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves steadily outward in cost-to-come space. As such, this algorithm combines features of both single-query algorithms (chiefly RRT) and multiple-query algorithms (chiefly PRM), and is conceptually related to the Fast Marching Method for the solution of eikonal equations. As a departure from previous analysis approaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the FMT* algorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra mathematical flexibility of this approach allows for significant algorithmic advantages and is of independent interest. Numerical experiments over a range of dimensions and obstacle configurations confirm our theoretical and heuristic arguments by showing that FMT returns substantially better solutions than either PRM* or RRT*.},

  abstract = {Given two points in a plane, each with a prescribed direction of motion in it, the question being asked is to find the shortest smooth path of bounded curvature that joins them. The classical 1957 result by Dubins gives a sufficient set of paths (each consisting of circular arcs and straight line segments) which always contains the shortest path. The latter is then found by explicitly computing all paths on the list and then comparing them. This may become a problem in applications where computation time is critical, such as in real-time robot motion planning. Instead, the logical classification scheme considered in this work allows one to extract the shortest path from the Dubins set directly, without explicitly calculating the candidate paths. The approach is demonstrated on one of two possible cases that appear here - when the distance between the two points is relatively large (the case with short distances can be treated similarly). Besides computational savings, this result sheds light on the nature of factors affecting the length of paths in the Dubins problem, and is useful for further extensions, e.g. for finding the shortest path between a point and a manifold in the corresponding configuration space. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

We assume that the system has independent bounded control over the altitude velocity as well as the turning rate in the plane. Through the use of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, we characterize the time-optimal trajectories for the system. They are composed of turns with minimum radius, straight line segments, and pieces of planar elastica. One motivation for determining these elementary pieces is for use as motion primitives in modern planning and control algorithms that consider obstacles.},

The set of queries includes discrete collision detection, continuous collision detection, separaHornung\cite{Hornung2013}, tion distance computation and penetration depth estimation. The input models may correspond to triangulated rigid or deformable models and articulated models. Moreover, FCL can perform probabilistic collision checking between noisy point clouds that are captured using cameras or LIDAR sensors. The main benefit of FCL lies in the fact that it provides a unified interface that can be used by various applications. Furthermore, its flexible architecture makes it easier to implement new algorithms within this framework. The runtime performance of the library is comparable to state of the art collision and proximity algorithms. We demonstrate its performance on synthetic datasets as well as motion planning and grasping computations performed using a two-armed mobile manipulation robot.},

To remove this limitation, a new path planning problem is proposed: two curvature constraints are added to the classical kinematic constraints taken into account. Thus, the curvature must remain continuous, and its derivative is bounded (as the car-like robot can reorient its directing wheels with a limited speed only). For this problem, the existence of solutions and the characterization of those of optimal length are shown. A method solving the forward-only problem (i.e. the problem for a car moving only forward) is then presented, and this method is compared to the classical one w.r.t. the complexity and computation time, the length of the generated paths and the quality of the tracking},

We use the RRT* algorithm to generate an initial route through a 3D environment and then construct a trajectory consisting of a sequence of polynomial spline segments to follow that route. We present a method of jointly optimizing polynomial path segments that is numerically stable for high-order polynomials and large numbers of segments, and is easily formulated for efficient sparse computation. Using a differentially flat repre- sentation of the quadrotor, these polynomial trajectories encode the complete dynamics of the vehicle and allow calculation of feed-forward control commands in closed form, eliminating the need to sample in a high-dimensional state space or carry out expensive dynamics simulations during planning. Our approach generates high-quality trajectories much faster than purely sampling-based kinodynamic planning methods, but sacrifices convergence to the global optimum. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by efficiently generating a trajectories through challenging indoor spaces and successfully traversing them at speeds up to 8m/s},

@Article{Kim2018DeepFluids,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel generative model to synthesize fluid simulations from a set of reduced parameters. A convolutional neural network is trained on a collection of discrete, parameterizable fluid simulation velocity fields. Due to the capability of deep learning architectures to learn representative features of the data, our generative model is able to accurately approximate the training data set, while providing plausible interpolated in-betweens. The proposed generative model is optimized for fluids by a novel loss function that guarantees divergence-free velocity fields at all times. In addition, we demonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and advance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second network. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling applications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids with different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and compression of fluid simulation data. Reconstructed velocity fields are generated up to 700x faster than traditional CPU solvers, while achieving compression rates of over 1300x.},
